## 2026-09-08 — node3 release canary upgrade

Only local regtest follower `vtr-node3` was upgraded to commit
`84125ea5c273d0380778d6c60933c063cacff17e`. Node1 (the staker), node2,
Bitcoin regtest, monitoring, and production seeds were not restarted or upgraded.
CI was green and all 17 release-mode recovery tests passed before this operation.

- Preflight: all three nodes agreed at height 2663; node1 staking enabled,
  node3 staking disabled. Node3 reached height 2664 before shutdown.
- Graceful stop: `2026-09-08T08:08:01.959253307Z`, exit code 0.
- Backup: stopped `/data/node3` and the previous daemon binary copied to private,
  git-ignored `.ops-backups/node3-20260908-dvqrcV/`. Its README records checksums
  and rollback precautions. This local backup is not an off-site backup.
- Restart: `2026-09-08T08:08:46.826859663Z`, with unchanged container arguments,
  volumes, network mode, and seed configuration.
- Replay completed at height 2664 at `08:09:16.845879Z`; peer handshake completed
  at `08:09:16.958609Z`, then node3 caught up to height 2665.
- No derived-UTXO repair warning or replay error appeared during startup.
- Fresh block 2666 arrived at node3 at `08:10:35.275023Z`. All three RPC endpoints
  agreed on `3f2c7fddfb2563f0fd0fbc48e9c9a3b3f15d225fc21bf733bad0dfe63cd847e1`.
  Node3 also accepted block 2667 at `08:13:33.275060Z`.
- Docker health was healthy with restart count 0. Node3 remained a follower;
  node1 was still staking at the `08:16:15Z` follow-up.

Installed binary SHA-256:
`1275b1f06c7b0d6076d3b36a9c9fbceda8e0ecaaa1bfd869d84830c955da79ce`.
The installed checksum matched the locally tested release binary.

This is a container-writable-layer canary, not an image rollout. The shared
`vtorrent/node:soak` image and Compose configuration were deliberately unchanged.
Recreating node3 from that image would revert its binary; prepare a versioned
image before treating this as a durable fleet rollout.

Node3's availability was interrupted from graceful shutdown until RPC startup
after replay (about 75 seconds). Do not count this interval as uninterrupted
three-node availability. The existing seven-day soak checklist remains pending;
subsequent observations are from a mixed-version fleet until another explicitly
approved rollout.
